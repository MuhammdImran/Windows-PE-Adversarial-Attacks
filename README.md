### The repository contains code referred to the work:  
# Evaluating Realistic Adversarial Attacks against Machine Learning Models for Windows PE Malware Detection  
### Installation  
As the dataset contains harmful malware binary files, installing a virtual machine to run this code is better. To replicate the experiments, install the following packages.  
* python 3.6.13
* keras 2.6
* tensorflow 2.6.2
* scikit learn 0.24.2
* pandas 1.1.5
* numpy 1.19.5
* lief 0.9.0
* joblib 1.1.1
* lightgbm 4.1.0
* tqdm 4.64.1
* jupyter notebook 6.4.3
* ember 0.1.0 ([https://pypi.org/project/hyperopt](https://github.com/elastic/ember/tree/master)https://github.com/elastic/ember/tree/master/)
### Description for this repository
Adversarial training was performed using Windows PE malware adversarial binary files generated by Extend, Full DOS, Shift, FGSM padding+slack, and GAMMA attacks. Original malware, goodware, and adversarial binary files generated by each attack can be downloaded through

Before running the notebooks for adversarial training, create directories, folders and save data in these folders using the following structure. The illustrated example shows adversarial training using binary files generated by the GAMMA attack; you can modify them for other attacks.
